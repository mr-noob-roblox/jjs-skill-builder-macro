# why
there is no cloning blocks in skill builder even if there is then this would be useful for sharing creations

# download
none (yet) because the macro functions are not created at runtime and you have to edit the source code and compile it

# usage
its recommended you place a neon white wall and go behind it and have it non collidable so the program can scan where to click efficently

this may not work on lower resolutions its recommended you have 1920x1080 for your screen otherwise you have to edit the code to support your screen resolution

# contribution
add more stuff in assets

skills are completely modular no need for extra programming
properties for blocks require programming
